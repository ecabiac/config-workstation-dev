# Ethan's Workstation Config

This repo houses many of the configurations I use for my personal workstation. Feel free to use this setup as a guide, but unless you are me don't expect to just be able to spin up the whole system and expect it to work.

Of paricular interest is probably the docker swarm setup, details of which can be found [here](docker-swarm/README.md).
